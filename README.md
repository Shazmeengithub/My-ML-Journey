# My Machine Learning Journey. This repository is a comprehensive record of my journey in learning Machine Learning. It includes both my past accomplishments, such as the **Machine Learning Specialization** by Andrew Ng, and my current challenge: **100 Days of Machine Learning** inspired by the [https://www.youtube.com/@campusx-official]
üìú Completed: Machine Learning Specialization (Andrew Ng on Coursera)

I have successfully completed the [Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng] on Coursera[https://coursera.org/share/03caa67d0e9f4ce960087a6b490ced11], covering topics like:
- Supervised Learning (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression)
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Anomaly Detection)
- Recommender Systems
- Reinforcement Learning
Current Challenge: 100 Days of Machine Learning

I am currently participating in the **100 Days of Machine Learning** challenge, inspired by the [CampusX YouTube Channel]. Each day, I tackle different topics and projects, and document my progress in this repository.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies I'm Using:
- Python
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Flask for deployment

üìÖ Future Goals:
- Dive deeper into advanced topics like GANs, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning.
- Apply my knowledge to real-world projects and research.
- Collaborate on open-source machine learning projects.
